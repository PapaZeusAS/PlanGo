# PlanGoes

PlanGoes is an cross platform app designed and developed by students from the University of Applied Sciences Flensburg.
PlanGoes makes organizing events easier than ever before. You want to plan your own party, prepare a meeting for your boss or just want to spend a cozy evening with friends? With the help of PlanGoes you can organize your events easily and in seconds! No matter whether at work or at home.

## What do we offer?

After the free download, you can create a personalized profile, which allows you to be informed about upcoming events at any time. You will receive information about the location, the participants, the date, the start time and a short description of each event. Furthermore, you will get an overview of which items are needed for the event and who will bring them.

## How does it work?
As an organizer you can create an event in less than 2 minutes. All you have to do is give your event a name and add the location, date and time. After that you should enter a short description and the event is created. You will now receive a link which you can forward to the potential participants. If they open the link, they will automatically be added to the event. The admin can also select items that are needed for the event. The participants can then choose which items they want to bring to the event. An excellent overview of each event is displayed.

Plan your events fast and easy in the future and make PlanGoes your planning app!
